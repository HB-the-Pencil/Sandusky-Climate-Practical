        <p>
            Sandusky sits at the southern end of Lake Erie and is not at great
            risk for flooding, tornadoes, or earthquakes.
            <a href="https://firststreet.org/city/sandusky-oh/3970380_fsid/flood">firststreet.org</a>
            rates Sandusky's flood risk as "minor". Looking at the graphs,
            July 18, 2016 had the highest wind speeds and precipitation out of
            the data collected.

        <p>
            There is some history of hail in Sandusky, with reports of quarter-sized
            hail in mid-July over the past 10 years. Based on our precipitation
            estimates, the 18th, 20th, and 22nd are the most likely days to have
            substantial precipitation, which could include hail.
